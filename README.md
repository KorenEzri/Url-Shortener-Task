# Introduction

This is a URL shortener microservice. It runs on my own jsonbin.io mock using the NPM package @korenezri/jsondb and has user-management features, persistency, statistics and a slick design.

Also, the password and user authentication system works on hashes and encryptions - safety first!

## Features

* Responsive
* Fully implemented sign-up form that allows you to log-in and your shortened URLs.
* Copy links with the click of a button!
* Slick design with more to come.
